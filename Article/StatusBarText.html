<h2>Introduction</h2>
In an MFC application, the status bar text for menu items is a built-in
feature. In the menu resource editor, you specify the text and, at runtime
as you move from menu item to menu item, a description will appear in the
status bar for each one. By default, this functionality is missing from
.NET Windows Forms applications. However, by using a component that
implements the <code>IExtenderProvider</code> interface, it is quite easy
to add this feature complete with design-time support and only requires you
to manually write a line or two of actual code. As a bonus, you can also
use it to add status bar text for any control on a form similar to the
<code>StatusBarText</code> property in controls found in Microsoft
Access.

<h2>Status Bar Text Provider Features</h2>
The <code>StatusBarTextProvider</code> is an
<code>IExtenderProvider</code> component that allows you to add status bar
text for menu items and form controls. When built for use with .NET 2.0, it
also supports status text on menu strip, tool strip, and status strip
items.  It provides the following features:

<ul>
    <li>When the component is dropped on the form, <code>MenuItem</code>
components, all <code>Control</code> type items, and
<code>ToolStripItem</code> components are extended with an extra
<code>StatusBar</code> category in their property window containing the
<code>StatusBarText</code> and <code>ShowAsBlank</code> properties. The
following items are not extended: <code>Form</code>, <code>Label</code>,
<code>PictureBox</code>, <code>ProgressBar</code>, <code>ScrollBar</code>,
<code>Splitter</code>, <code>StatusBar</code>, <code>ToolBar</code>,
<code>ToolStrip</code> and controls derived from them. The <code>Form</code>
contains controls and the other controls cannot receive the focus needed to
display the text so there is no point in giving them status bar text. The
exception to the above rule is <code>LinkLabel</code> which can receive the
focus and thus can be extended.</li>

    <li>The <code>StatusBarText</code> property is used to set the text to
display in the status bar when the item has the focus.</li>

    <li>The <code>ShowAsBlank</code> property can be used to have the item
show a blank status bar when it has the focus. This property is necessary
as the Visual Studio .NET designer converts strings of spaces to an empty
string and thus it does not serialize the blank string to code. Setting
this property to <code lang=cs>true</code> obtains the desired result of
blank status bar text for the item.</li>

    <li>The provider can use a common status bar on the application's main
form (i.e. an MDI container) or it can use a status bar local to the form
that contains it (i.e. a dialog box).</li>

    <li>The provider can be configured to display the status bar text in
any panel defined in the status bar. If the status bar does not have panels
defined, it will use the status bar's <code>Text</code> property instead.</li>

    <li>When built for use with .NET 2.0, you can specify any
<code>ToolStripStatusLabel</code> component as the place to display the text.
Note that since status labels can appear in toolbars as well, you are not
limited to displaying text in the application status bar for items.</li>

    <li>The provider works with modal and non-modal forms in single
document interface (SDI) and multiple document interface (MDI)
applications.</li>

    <li>Status bar text is correctly restored to its prior value when
leaving a control, closing a form, switching between forms, and when
entering or exiting a menu.</li>

    <li>Status bar text can be set on container controls such as
<code>GroupBox</code> and <code>Panel</code> and on classes derived from
<code>UserControl</code> to provide status bar text for controls within
them that do not have status bar text specified for themselves.</li>

    <li><code>UserControl</code> objects can supply their own status bar text
provider to define status bar text for the controls that they contain.</li>

    <li>When built for use with .NET 2.0, two extra static properties are
provided (<code>StatusLabel</code> and <code>ProgressBar</code>) that can be
used to gain access to a status label and progress bar on the main status
strip for the application to provide progress feedback for long running
processes from anywhere within the application.  In order to make using them
easier three overloaded methods are also provided:
    <ul class="method">
        <li><code>InitializeProgressBar</code> - This is used to initialize
the status label and progress bar for use (six overloads).</li>
        <li><code>UpdateProgress</code> - This is used to update the status
label and progress bar as you move through an operation (four overloads).</li>
        <li><code>ResetProgressBar</code> - This is used to reset the status
label and progress bar when done (2 overloads).</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>The supplied demo contains the assembly, a help file, and a demo
application. Versions are supplied for .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0.  See the help
file for details on installing the assembly in the Visual Studio .NET tool
box. You can also extract the <i>StatusBarTextProvider.cs</i> source file
for use in your own projects or control libraries.</p>

<h2>Using the Assembly in your Projects</h2>
The classes can be found in the assembly
<i>EWSoftware.StatusBarText.dll</i>. In order to use the classes, add a
reference to it in your project. The help file contains details on how to
do this if you need it. In the code modules that use classes from the
<code>EWSoftware.StatusBarText</code> namespace, you will have to add a
<code lang=cs>using</code> statement (<code lang=vbnet>Imports</code> in
VB.NET) for the <code>EWSoftware.StatusBarText</code> namespace.

<p>Naturally, you must add a status bar control (.NET 1.1) or a status
strip control containing at least one status label (.NET 2.0) to your form.

<h3>.NET 1.1 Setup</h3>
To define the common application status bar used by all instances of
<code>StatusBarTextProvider</code> and optionally the display panel to use,
add code similar to the following to your main form's constructor to set
the static <code>ApplicationStatusBar</code> and
<code>ApplicationDisplayPanel</code> properties:

<pre lang=cs>
// Define the default status bar to use in
// the main form's constructor
public MainForm()
{
    InitializeComponent();

    // Tell the StatusBarTextProvider component the status bar to use
    StatusBarTextProvider.ApplicationStatusBar = sbStatusBar;

    // You can also use any panel you like. The default is zero
    // (the left-most panel). For the demo, we'll use the one
    // in the middle.
    StatusBarTextProvider.ApplicationDisplayPanel = 1;
}
</pre>

<p>If your status bar control does not contain panels, you can omit setting
the <code>ApplicationDisplayPanel</code> property and the provider will use
the status bar's <code>Text</code> property to display the text
instead.</p>

<h3>.NET 2.0 Setup</h3>
Although not formally deprecated, the standard <code>MainMenu</code>,
<code>ToolBar</code>, <code>StatusBar</code> controls have been replaced by
the <code>MenuStrip</code>, <code>ToolStrip</code>, and
<code>StatusStrip</code> controls.  In fact, the old controls do not appear
in the toolbox by default.  When you get time, it would be a good idea to
update any existing applications to use the newer controls as they provide
some new features such as the ability to put text boxes, combo boxes, or
progress bar controls directly in the tool strips and status strips and to
have images on the menu items.

<p>When using a status strip, you specify the status label tool strip item
used by all instances of <code>StatusBarTextProvider</code> rather than a
status bar component.  Add code similar to the following to your main
form's constructor to set the static <code>ApplicationStatusBar</code>
property.  If your status strip also contains a label and/or progress bar
tool strip item, you can set the static <code>StatusLabel</code> and
<code>ProgressBar</code> properties as well to provide all forms in your
application convenient access to them and to make use of the status methods
for them on the provider as noted earlier.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
// Define the default status strip label to use in
// the main form's constructor.
public MainForm()
{
    InitializeComponent();

    // Tell the StatusBarTextProvider component the component
    // to use to display the text.  When using a tool strip
    // component, the ApplicationDisplayPanel property is ignored.
    StatusBarTextProvider.ApplicationStatusBar = tslStatusText;

    // Define the status label and progress bar too.  This allows
    // easy access to those items from anywhere within the
    // application.
    StatusBarTextProvider.StatusLabel = tslProgressNote;
    StatusBarTextProvider.ProgressBar = tspbProgressBar;
}
</pre>

<p>Since a tool strip item is used in this situation, the
<code>ApplicationDisplayPanel</code> property is always ignored.

<h3>The Instance Status Bar</h3>
Optionally, you can use the <code>InstanceStatusBar</code> and
<code>InstanceDisplayPanel</code> properties in code to override the
application-level status bar and display panel settings on a form-by-form
basis. The example code below is from the demo and is used to switch
between using the child form's status bar and the main form's status bar.
<code>sbMessage</code> is the status bar text provider for the child form
and <code>ucDemo.StatusBarTextProvider</code> is used to access the status
bar text provider for a user control that appears on the child form.

<pre lang=cs>
private void chkUseDialog_CheckedChanged(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    if(chkUseDialog.Checked)
    {
        // Use the dialog box's status bar when checked
        sbMessage.InstanceStatusBar = sbDialog;
        ucDemo.StatusBarTextProvider.InstanceStatusBar = sbDialog;

        // Make the instance default text the same for any nested
        // status bar text providers.  If not, they pick up the
        // status bar text of the current control as the default.
        ucDemo.StatusBarTextProvider.InstanceDefaultText =
            sbMessage.InstanceDefaultText;
    }
    else
    {
        // Go back to using the main form's status bar
        sbMessage.InstanceStatusBar = null;
        ucDemo.StatusBarTextProvider.InstanceStatusBar = null;
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Design-time Support</h2>
To use the <code>StatusBarTextProvider</code>, simply drag it from the
toolbox and drop it on your form. Once done, all <code>MenuItem</code>
components, <code>Control</code> type objects, and
<code>ToolStripItem</code> components on the form will have an extra
<code>StatusBar</code> category in their property window. Using it, you can
set the <code>StatusBarText</code> and <code>ShowAsBlank</code>
properties.

<p>Normally, you will just enter a message to display in the
<code>StatusBarText</code> property. As noted above, the
<code>ShowAsBlank</code> property exists so that in the rare event when you
want a blank status bar for an item, you can set this property to <code
lang=cs>true</code>. The designer converts a string containing nothing but
spaces to an empty string. Since this is the default value, it does not get
serialized to code thus the extra property is needed.</p>

<h2>Status Bar Text on TabControl and TabPage Controls</h2>
<code>TabControl</code> and <code>TabPage</code> controls do not always
reliably show their status bar text due to the way they handle the focus.
Steps have been taken to allow status bar text on these controls but there
are a couple of known problems with no workarounds:

<ul>
    <li>First and foremost is the requirement that you set the
<code>ShowAsBlank</code> property to <code lang=cs>true</code> or define
some <code>StatusBarText</code> for the <code>TabControl</code> itself so
that status bar text can be displayed for the individual tab pages. This
refers to the text shown if a control on a page has no status bar text or
when the tab itself has the focus. As with other container controls, if you
do not define status bar text for the tab pages, the status bar text for
the tab control will be shown instead.
    <li>The tab control will not show the status bar text if you use
Shift+Tab to go from the first control on a tab back to the tab itself or,
occasionally, when it is the first control to have the focus when the form
is opened. Moving from one tab to another or moving the focus to a control
outside the tab control and then back to the tab control will get it to
start showing the status bar text for the tabs again.</li>
</ul>

<p>One final note regarding the designer: When setting the status bar text
for the tab pages, be sure to actually click on a part of the tab page to
ensure that it is selected. If you just click the tab in the tab control's
header to select it, the tab control will have the focus in the designer
and you may inadvertently modify the tab control's status bar text rather
than the text for the tab page.</p>

<h2>Status Text on Tool Strip Items</h2>
Under .NET 2.0, status bar text can be specified for menu strip, tool
strip, and status strip items.  However, there are a few limitations with
no workarounds.

<ul>
    <li>For menu strip items, text is only displayed when the mouse moves in
and out of the menu items.  If navigating the menus with the keyboard, the
status text is not displayed.  Unfortunately, the menu strip items do not fire
selection events like the menu items from .NET 1.1 so it is not possible to
display text for them in this situation.</li>

    <li>For tool strip and status strip items, status text will be shown when
you move the mouse over them.  In addition if you tab into a combo box or a
text box the status text will update.  However, when tabbing onto a button
control, no status text will be displayed.  As with the menu strip items,
there is no selection event to hook to enable it.

    <li>With the prior version of this control under .NET 1.1, it was
always possible to restore the prior text when moving from a form, to the
menu, and back to the form.  However, under .NET 2.0 with the above
limitations I had to make a compromise and rework how the original status
bar text was restored.  This affects the component under both .NET 1.1 and
.NET 2.0. As such, there are some cases where when moving from a menu back
to the form, the status bar text for the current control will not be
displayed.  Instead, the default text will appear in the status bar.
Tabbing out of the control and back in will display the correct text again.
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
To create an extender provider, you need to derive a class from
<code>Component</code> and implement the <code>IExtenderProvider</code>
interface. The interface contains a single method (<code>CanExtend</code>)
that returns <code lang=cs>true</code> or <code lang=cs>false</code> based
on whether or not it can provide its properties to the object it receives
as a parameter. In this case, we check the type of the passed object to see
if it is the one that we can extend.

<p>Throughout the following code, the <code>DOTNET_20</code> definition is
used to conditionally compile code related to the modifications needed to
support the .NET 2.0 components.  It is defined at the top of the file.
Comment it out to build the code under .NET 1.1.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
public class StatusBarTextProvider : Component, IExtenderProvider
{
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Default constructor
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public StatusBarTextProvider()
    {
        htOptions = new Hashtable(25);
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Constructor. This one takes a reference to a container.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;param name="container"&gt;The container for the
    /// component&lt;/param&gt;
    public StatusBarTextProvider(IContainer container) : this()
    {
        if(container != null)
            container.Add(this);
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// This is implemented to determine if the component can be
    /// extended with the extra properties.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;param name="extendee"&gt;The object to check&lt;/param&gt;
    public bool CanExtend(object extendee)
    {
        // MenuItem is a Component.  LinkLabel derives from Label but
        // it can gain the focus and thus can be extended.  For .NET 2.0,
        // we also support the ToolStripItem component.
#if !DOTNET_20
        if(extendee is MenuItem || extendee is LinkLabel)
#else
        if(extendee is MenuItem || extendee is LinkLabel ||
          extendee is ToolStripItem)
#endif
            return true;

        // Non-Control types, Form, and these specific controls can't be
        // extended as it doesn't make sense for them as they don't gain
        // the focus needed to display the text.
        if(!(extendee is Control) || extendee is Form ||
          extendee is Label || extendee is PictureBox ||
          extendee is ProgressBar || extendee is ScrollBar ||
          extendee is Splitter || extendee is StatusBar ||
#if !DOTNET_20
          extendee is ToolBar)
#else
          extendee is ToolBar || extendee is ToolStrip)
#endif
            return false;

        // All other Control types can be extended
        return true;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>In addition you need to specify the <code>ProvideProperty</code>
attributes on the class for each extended property that you will provide.
The attribute takes the name of the property and the type to which it
applies. In the case of the <code>StatusBarTextProvider</code> I chose to
specify <code>Component</code> as the type so that it can be applied in a
generic fashion to menu items, controls, and tool strip items alike.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
[ProvideProperty("StatusBarText", typeof(Component)),
 ProvideProperty("ShowAsBlank", typeof(Component))]
public class StatusBarTextProvider : Component, IExtenderProvider
{
    ... class code ...
}
</pre>

<p>The next step is to actually implement the code for the provided
properties. Although they act like properties in the designer, you actually
create two methods (a GetXXX and a SetXXX method where XXX is the name of
the property). The Get method receives a reference to the object that is
being extended. The Set method receives a reference to the object that is
being extended and a value for the extended property. The type for the
object should match the type specified in the attribute. The type for the
value parameter received by the Set method can be any type that you need.
Internally, you are free to track and store the values as you see fit. The
easiest approach is to create a hash table and use the object as the key
and the value parameter as the value for the hash table entry. If you are
providing multiple properties as in the case of the
<code>StatusBarTextProvider</code>, it is worthwhile to create a separate
class for the properties and use that as the item to store in the hash
table.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This class contains the options for the items that need status
/// bar text.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
private sealed class PropertyOptions
{
    //============================================================
    // Private data member

    private string message;
    private bool showAsBlank;

    //============================================================
    // Properties

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Set or get the message text
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public string Message
    {
        get { return message; }
        set { message = value; }
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// The "show as blank" flag
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public bool ShowAsBlank
    {
        get { return showAsBlank; }
        set { showAsBlank = value; }
    }

    //============================================================
    // Methods, etc.

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Constructor
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;param name="msg"&gt;The message text to display&lt;/param&gt;
    /// &lt;overloads&gt;There are two overloads for the
    /// constructor&lt;/overloads&gt;
    public PropertyOptions(string msg)
    {
        message = msg;
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Constructor
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;param name="showBlank"&gt;The "show as blank"
    /// flag&lt;/param&gt;
    public PropertyOptions(bool showBlank)
    {
        showAsBlank = showBlank;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Here is an example of a Get method for the <code>StatusBarText</code>
property. After some checks to make sure the passed component is valid and
is supported, it simply checks to see if the hash table contains the
component. If it does, it casts the value from the hash table to our
property options class from above and returns the message text from it. If
the hash table does not contain the component yet, it returns <code
lang=cs>null</code>. Also note that you can provide design-time attributes
on the Get method such as <code>Category</code>, <code>DefaultValue</code>,
etc. to provide better designer support for the extender provider.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This is used to retrieve the status bar text for a component.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="comp"&gt;The component for which to get the
/// status bar text&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;The message string if found or null if not
/// found&lt;/returns&gt;
[Category("StatusBar"), Localizable(true), DefaultValue(null),
  Description("The status bar text for the item")]
public string GetStatusBarText(Component comp)
{
    if(comp == null)
        throw new ArgumentException("Component cannot be null");

#if !DOTNET_20
    if(!(comp is MenuItem) && !(comp is Control))
#else
    if(!(comp is MenuItem) && !(comp is Control) &&
      !(comp is ToolStripItem))
#endif
        throw new ArgumentException(
            "Component must be a MenuItem, ToolStripItem, " +
                "or a Control");

    if(htOptions.Contains(comp))
        return ((PropertyOptions)htOptions[comp]).Message;

    return null;
}
</pre>

<p>The Set method works in a similar fashion. If the hash table does not
contain the component, you create an instance of the property options
class, store the value in it, and add it to the hash table. If the
component is already in the hash table, you simply retrieve the existing
settings and update them with the new value.</p>

<p>In the case of <code>StatusBarTextProvider</code>, things get a little
more complicated. In addition to storing the property value we also need to
hook up several events so that we can adjust the status bar text as the
various controls and menu items gain and lose the focus. The first part is
fairly straightforward. We check to make sure the object is valid and
create some helper variables that will let us determine the type of the
object so that we can hook up or disconnect the appropriate events.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This stores the status bar text for the specified component.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="comp"&gt;The component associated with the
/// message&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="message"&gt;The status bar text for the
/// component&lt;/param&gt;
public void SetStatusBarText(Component comp, string message)
{
    if(comp == null)
        throw new ArgumentException("Component cannot be null");

    MenuItem mi = comp as MenuItem;
    Control ctl = comp as Control;
    TabControl tc = comp as TabControl;

#if DOTNET_20
    ToolStripItem ti = comp as ToolStripItem;
    ToolStripControlHost tsch = comp as ToolStripControlHost;

    if(mi == null && ti == null && ctl == null)
#else
    if(mi == null && ctl == null)
#endif
        throw new ArgumentException(
            "Component must be a MenuItem, " +
            "ToolStripItem, or a Control");

    if(message != null && message.Length == 0)
        message = null;
</pre>

<p>If the hash table does not already contain the object, we create a new
property object containing the message and add it to the hash table using
the object as the key. Then, based on the object type, we hook up one or
more event handlers that will display the appropriate status bar text. This
step is skipped at design-time though. For <code>MenuItem</code> objects,
we hook up the <code>Select</code> event.  For <code>ToolStripItem</code>
objects, we hook up the <code>MouseEnter</code> and <code>MouseLeave</code>
events.  If the tool strip item is a <code>ToolStripControlHost</code>
(i.e. it hosts a control such as a combo box or text box), we also hook up
the <code>Enter</code> and <code>Leave</code> events so that status text is
shown when tabbing into the control.  For all other standard form controls
we hook up the <code>GotFocus</code>, <code>Enter</code>, and
<code>Leave</code> events. Some controls such as <code>Panel</code> cannot
receive the focus but are entered which is why both <code>GotFocus</code>
and <code>Enter</code> are used.</p>

<p>If it is a tab control, we also have to hook up the
<code>SelectedIndexChanged</code> event to allow displaying the status bar
text for it and its pages. The tab control and tab pages do not reliably
show their status bar text due to the way they handle the focus. As such,
this event is needed to update the text. Note that it will not show the
text if you use Shift+Tab to go from the first control on a tab back to the
tab in the tab control itself or when it is the first control to have the
focus. You must also set <code>ShowAsBlank</code> or
<code>StatusBarText</code> on the tab control itself if you want to have
status bar text appear for the tab pages themselves (i.e. when the tab
itself has the focus).</p>

<h2>The Menu Item Event Handlers</h2>
The event handlers are where most of the action takes place. For menu
items, the <code>Menu_Select</code> event handles setting of the status bar
text for the item. In addition, the first time it is called, it also hooks
up an event handler on the parent form's <code>MenuComplete</code> event so
that it can restore the text that was in the status bar prior to the item's
text. The <code>StatusBar</code>, <code>CurrentStatusBarText</code>,
<code>ItemText</code>, and <code>StatusBarDefaultText</code> properties are
used to obtain references to the current status bar, its current text, the
item's text, and the default status bar text based on the current settings
(i.e. whether it is using the application status bar or an instance in a
dialog box).

<pre lang=cs>
// This is handled to display status bar text for a MenuItem
// component.
private void Menu_Select(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if(this.StatusBar == null || !htOptions.Contains(sender))
        return;

    // Hook the MenuComplete event on first use to restore
    // the existing status bar text.
    if(!hookedMenuEvents)
    {
        Form frm = this.StatusBarParentForm;

        if(frm != null)
        {
            frm.MenuComplete += new EventHandler(
                Form_MenuComplete);
            hookedMenuEvents = true;
        }
    }

    this.CurrentStatusBarText = this.ItemText(sender);
}

// This is handled so that the old status bar text is restored
// when the component status bar text is no longer needed.
private void Form_MenuComplete(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    if(this.StatusBar == null)
        return;

    this.CurrentStatusBarText = this.StatusBarDefaultText;
}
</pre>

<h2>Other Control Event Handlers</h2>
For all other controls, the <code>Control_Enter</code> and
<code>Control_Leave</code> events are used. On first use, the
<code>Control_Enter</code> handler hooks up events on the parent form's
<code>Activated</code>, <code>Deactivated</code>, and <code>Closed</code>
events so that the existing status bar text can be restored.

<pre lang=cs>
// This is handled to display status bar text when a control
// is entered or gains the focus.
private void Control_Enter(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if(this.StatusBar == null || !htOptions.Contains(sender))
        return;

    // Hook the Closed event to reset the status bar text
    // when the form is closed.  When it's modal, it doesn't
    // always get the Leave event to reset the text.  The
    // Activated and Deactivated events are also hooked to
    // set and restore the text.
    if(!hookedFormEvent && this.StatusBar != null)
    {
        Control p = sender as Control;

        if(p != null)
            p = p.Parent;
#if DOTNET_20
        else    // It's a control hosted in a tool strip item
            p = ((ToolStripItem)sender).Owner.Parent;
#endif

        while(p != null)
        {
            Form frm = p as Form;

            if(frm != null)
            {
                frm.Activated += new EventHandler(
                    Form_Activated);

                // Same handler as Form.MenuComplete
                frm.Deactivate += new EventHandler(
                    Form_MenuComplete);
                frm.Closed += new EventHandler(
                    Form_MenuComplete);

                hookedFormEvent = true;
                break;
            }

            p = p.Parent;
        }
    }

    this.CurrentStatusBarText = this.ItemText(sender);
}

// This is handled to display status bar text when a control
// is left.
private void Control_Leave(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if(this.StatusBar == null || !htOptions.Contains(sender))
        return;

    this.CurrentStatusBarText = this.StatusBarDefaultText;
}

// This is handled to redisplay the status bar text for the
// form's focused control when activated.
private void Form_Activated(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    Form frm = sender as Form;

    if(frm != null && this.StatusBar != null)
    {
        Control ctl = frm.ActiveControl;

        // Nested controls may not have any so walk up
        // the parent chain to see if they do.
        while(ctl != null && !htOptions.Contains(ctl))
            ctl = ctl.Parent;

        if(ctl != null)
            this.CurrentStatusBarText = this.ItemText(ctl);

<h2>Demonstration Applications</h2>
A Windows Forms application in C# and VB.NET is provided that
demonstrates the basic use of the status bar text provider.  A version of
each is provided for .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0. The .NET 1.1 version
demonstrates the use of the provider with menu items and with controls in
modal and non-modal forms.  The .NET 2.0 version demonstrates the use of
the provider with menu strip, tool strip, and status strip items along with
standard controls in modal and non-modal forms.  It also demonstrates the
use of the extra <code>StatusLabel</code> and <code>ProgressBar</code>
properties to access a status label and progress bar in the main status
strip from within the demo dialog box form.

<p>For either version, use the <b>File | Load</b> option to open non-modal
instances of the demo form. Use the <b>Help | About</b> option to open a
modal instance of the demo form. The demo form allows you to switch between
using the application's status bar/status strip and the demo form's status
bar for displaying the messages.</p>
